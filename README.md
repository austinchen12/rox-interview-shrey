# rox-interview-shrey
"""
This interview will focus on your frontend knowledge: UX intuition, UI skills.

One of our main value adds is our generate email feature. Across the product, we allow users to generate an email given some context, like a specific contact, recent insights, uploaded artifacts, email templates (for structure/formatting). 

Main flow
* User can specify a prompt, hit submit, and get an email back. Should also be able to edit the email here so they can copy and paste the final draft into their email client

Followups (In case you're indifferent, these are ordered by most interesting for me. If you have a preference, please go with that)
* User can save prompts on some backend. They can then load these prompts and update them so changes are persisted as well.
* User can specify some additional steps after initial generation for the LLM to tweak and improve the email.
* User should be able to specify additional context, like users, insights, uploaded files, email template strings, etc.
